## About

**Zappa** makes it super easy to deploy all Python WSGI applications on AWS Lambda + API Gateway. Think of it as "serverless" web hosting for your Python web apps.

> What do you mean "serverless"?

Okay, so there still is a server - but it only has a _40 millisecond_ life cycle! Serverless in this case means **"without any permanent infrastucture."**

With a traditional HTTP server, the server is online 24/7, processing requests one by one as they come in. If the queue of incoming requests grows too large, some requests will time out. With Zappa, **each request is given its own virtual HTTP "server"** by Amazon API Gateway. AWS handles the horizontal scaling automatically, so no requests ever time out. Each request then calls your application from a memory cache in AWS Lambda and returns the response via Python's WSGI interface. After your app returns, the "server" dies.

Better still, with Zappa you only pay for the milliseconds of server time that you use, so it's many **orders of magnitude cheaper** than VPS/PaaS hosts like Linode or Heroku - and in most cases, it's completely free. Plus, there's no need to worry about load balancing or keeping servers online ever again.

It's great for deploying serverless microservices with frameworks like Flask and Bottle, and for hosting larger web apps and CMSes with Django. Or, you can use any WSGI-compatible app you like! You **probably don't need to change your existing applications** to use it, and you're not locked into using it.

And finally, Zappa is **super easy to use**. You can deploy your application with a single command out of the box.  

Using **Zappa** means:

* **No more** tedious web server configuration!
* **No more** paying for 24/7 server uptime!
* **No more** worrying about load balancing / scalability!
* **No more** worrying about keeping servers online!

__Awesome!__

## Installation and Configuration

_Before you begin, make sure you have a valid AWS account and your [AWS credentials file](https://blogs.aws.amazon.com/security/post/Tx3D6U6WSFGOK2H/A-New-and-Standardized-Way-to-Manage-Credentials-in-the-AWS-SDKs) is properly installed._

**Zappa** can easily be installed through pip, like so:

    $ pip install zappa

Please note that Zappa _**must**_ be installed into your project's [virtual environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/). 

_(If you use [pyenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv) and love to manage virtualenvs with **pyenv-virtualenv**, you just have to call `pyenv local [your_venv_name]` and it's ready. [Conda](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/) users should comment [here](https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa/pull/108).)_

Next, you'll need to define your local and server-side settings.

#### Running the Initial Setup / Settings

**Zappa** can automatically set up your deployment settings for you with the `init` command:

    $ zappa init

This will automatically detect your application type and help you define your deployment configuration settings. Once you finish initialization, you'll have a file named *zappa_settings.json* in your project directory defining your deployment settings. It will probably look something like this:

```javascript
{
    "dev": { // The name of your environment
       "s3_bucket": "lmbda", // The name of your S3 bucket
       "app_function": "your_module.app" // The python path to your WSGI application function. In Flask, this is your 'app' object.
    }
}
```

You can define as many environments as your like - we recommend having _dev_, _staging_, and _production_.

Now, you're ready to deploy!

## Basic Usage

#### Initial Deployments

Once your settings are configured, you can package and deploy your application to an environment called "production" with a single command:

    $ zappa deploy production
    Deploying..
    Your application is now live at: https://7k6anj0k99.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/production

And now your app is **live!** How cool is that?!

To explain what's going on, when you call `deploy`, Zappa will automatically package up your application and local virtual environment into a Lambda-compatible archive, replace any dependencies with versions [precompiled for Lambda](https://github.com/Miserlou/lambda-packages), set up the function handler and necessary WSGI Middleware, upload the archive to S3, register it as a new Lambda function, create a new API Gateway resource, create WSGI-compatible routes for it, link it to the new Lambda function, and finally delete the archive from your S3 bucket. Handy!

#### Updates

If your application has already been deployed and you only need to upload new Python code, but not touch the underlying routes, you can simply:

    $ zappa update production
    Updating..
    Your application is now live at: https://7k6anj0k99.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/production

This creates a new archive, uploads it to S3 and updates the Lambda function to use the new code, but doesn't touch the API Gateway routes.

#### Rollback

You can also `rollback` the deployed code to a previous version by supplying the number of revisions to return to. For instance, to rollback to the version deployed 3 versions ago:

    $ zappa rollback production -n 3

#### Scheduling

Zappa can be used to easily schedule functions to occur on regular intervals.
These functions will be packaged and deployed along with your `app_function` and called from the handler automatically.
Just list your functions and the expression to schedule them using [cron or rate syntax](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/tutorial-scheduled-events-schedule-expressions.html) in your *zappa_settings.json* file:

```javascript
{
    "production": {
       ...
       "events": [{
           "function": "your_module.your_function", // The function to execute
           "expression": "rate(1 minute)" // When to execute it (in cron or rate format)
       }],
       ...
    }
}
```

And then:

    $ zappa schedule production

And now your function will execute every minute!

If you want to cancel these, you can simply use the `unschedule` command:

    $ zappa unschedule production

And now your scheduled event rules are deleted.

See the [example](example/) for more details.

#### Executing in Response to AWS Events

Similarly, you can have your functions execute in response to events that happen in the AWS ecosystem, such as S3 uploads, DynamoDB entries, Kinesis streams, and SNS messages.

In your *zappa_settings.json* file, define your [event sources](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invoking-lambda-function.html) and the function you wish to execute. For instance, this will execute `your_module.your_function` in response to new objects in your `my-bucket` S3 bucket. Note that `your_function` must accept `event` and `context` paramaters.

```javascript
{
    "production": {
       ...
       "events": [{
            "function": "your_module.your_function",
            "event_source": {
                  "arn":  "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket",
                  "events": [
                    "s3:ObjectCreated:*"
                  ]
               }
            }],
       ...
    }
}
```

And then:

    $ zappa schedule production

And now your function will execute every time a new upload appears in your bucket!

#### Undeploy

If you need to remove the API Gateway and Lambda function that you have previously published, you can simply:

    $ zappa undeploy production

You will be asked for confirmation before it executes.

If you enabled CloudWatch Logs for your API Gateway service and you don't
want to keep those logs, you can specify the `--remove-logs` argument to purge the logs for your API Gateway and your Lambda function:

    $ zappa undeploy production --remove-logs

#### Status

If you need to see the status of your deployment and event schedules, simply use the `status` command.

    $ zappa status production

#### Tailing Logs

You can watch the logs of a deployment by calling the `tail` management command.

    $ zappa tail production

#### Remote Function Invocation

You can execute any function in your application directly at any time by using the `invoke` command.

For instance, suppose you have a basic application in a file called "my_app.py", and you want to invoke a function in it called "my_function". Once your application is deployed, you can invoke that function at any time by calling:

    $ zappa invoke production 'my_app.my_function'

Any remote print statements made and the value the function returned will then be printed to your local console. **Nifty!**

#### Django Management Commands

As a convenience, Zappa can also invoke remote Django 'manage.py' commands with the `manage` command. For instance, to perform the basic Django status check:

    $ zappa manage production check

Obviously, this only works for Django projects which have their settings properly defined. _(Please note that commands which take over 30 seconds to execute may time-out. See [this related issue](https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa/issues/205#issuecomment-236391248) for a work-around.)_ 

#### Let's Encrypt SSL Domain Certification and Installation

If you want to use Zappa applications on a custom domain or subdomain, you'll need to supply a valid SSL certificate. Fortunately for you, Zappa can automatically create and install free valid SSL certificates using Let's Encrypt!

If your domain is located within an AWS Route 53 Hosted Zone and you've defined `domain` and `lets_encrypt_key` (ex: `openssl genrsa 2048 > account.key`) settings, all you need to do is:

    $ zappa certify production

And your domain will be verified, certified and registered! 

_(Please note that this can take around 45 minutes to take effect the first time your run the command, and around 60 seconds every time after that.)_

More detailed instructions are available [in this handy guide](https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa/blob/master/docs/domain_with_free_ssl_dns.md).

## Advanced Settings

        }
    }
}
```

## Advanced Usage

#### Keeping The Server Warm

Zappa will automatically set up a regularly occuring execution of your application in order to keep the Lambda function warm. This can be disabled via the 'keep_warm' setting.

#### Serving Static Files / Binary Uploads

Zappa is for running your application code, not for serving static web assets. If you plan on serving custom static assets in your web application (CSS/JavaScript/images/etc.,), you'll likely want to use a combination of AWS S3 and AWS CloudFront.

Your web application framework will likely be able to handle this for you automatically. For Flask, there is [Flask-S3](https://github.com/e-dard/flask-s3), and for Django, there is [Django-Storages](https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Similarly, you will not be able to accept binary multi-part uploads through the API Gateway. Instead, you should design your application so that binary uploads go [directly to S3](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/guide/browser-examples.html#Uploading_a_local_file_using_the_File_API), which then triggers an event response defined in your `events` setting! That's thinking serverlessly!

#### Enabling CORS

To enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for your application, follow the [AWS "How to CORS" Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/how-to-cors.html) to enable CORS via the API Gateway Console. Don't forget to enable CORS per parameter and re-deploy your API after making the changes!

#### Enabling Secure Endpoints on API Gateway

You can use the `api_key_required` setting to generate and assign an API key to all the routes of your API Gateway. After redeployment, you can then pass the provided key as a header called `x-api-key` to access the restricted endpoints. Without the `x-api-key` header, you will receive a 403. [More information on API keys in the API Gateway](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/how-to-api-keys.html)

#### Deploying to a Domain With a Let's Encrypt Certificate (DNS Auth)

If you want to use Zappa on a domain with a free Let's Encrypt certificate using automatic Route 53 based DNS Authentication, you can follow [this handy guide](https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa/blob/master/docs/domain_with_free_ssl_dns.md).

#### Deploying to a Domain With a Let's Encrypt Certificate (HTTP Auth)

If you want to use Zappa on a domain with a free Let's Encrypt certificate using HTTP Authentication, you can follow [this guide](https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa/blob/master/docs/domain_with_free_ssl_http.md).

However, it's now far easier to use Route 53-based DNS authentication, which will allow you to use a Let's Encrypt certificate with a single `$ zappa certify` command.

#### Bundling Additionnal Packages like OpenCV

Some python packages can't easily be added to your virtualenv. It is quite easy to bundle them using Zappa. Simply add them to the root directory.

For example, to install OpenCV, go to [aeddi/aws-lambda-python-opencv](https://github.com/aeddi/aws-lambda-python-opencv) and download the pre-built archive. simply extract it in the root of your Zappa project.

#### Setting Environment Variables

If you want to use environment variables to configure your application (which is especially useful for things like sensitive credentials), you can create a file and place it in an S3 bucket to which your Zappa application has access to. To do this, add the `remote_env_bucket` and `remote_env_file` keys to zappa_settings pointing to a file containing a flat JSON object, so that each key-value pair on the object will be set as an environment variable and value whenever a new lambda instance spins up.

For example, to ensure your application has access to the database credentials without storing them in your version control, you can add a file to S3 with the connection string and load it into the lambda environment using the `remote_env_bucket` and `remote_env_file` configuration settings.

super-secret-config.json (uploaded to my-config-bucket):
```javascript
{
    "DB_CONNECTION_STRING": "super-secret:database"
}
```

zappa_settings.json:
```javascript
{
    "dev": {
        ...
        "remote_env_bucket": "my-config-bucket",
        "remote_env_file": "super-secret-config.json"
    },
    ...
}
```

Now in your application you can use:
```python
import os
db_string = os.environ('DB_CONNECTION_STRING')
```

#### Setting Integration Content-Type Aliases

By default, Zappa will only route the following MIME-types that are set explicitly via `Content-Type` header: `application/json`, `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, and `multipart/form-data` (if the Content-Type header isn't set, `application/json` will be the default). If a request comes in with `Content-Type` header set to anything but those 3 values, Amazon will return a 415 status code and a `MIME type not supported` message. If there is a need to support custom MIME-types (e.g. when a third-party making requests to your API) you can specify aliases for the 3 default types:

zappa_settings.json:
```javascript
{
    "dev": {
        ...
        "integration_content_type_aliases": {
            "application/json": ["application/vnd.webhooks+json"]
         }
    },
    ...
}
```

Now Zappa will use `application/json`'s template to route requests with MIME-type of `application/vnd.webhooks+json`. You will need to re-deploy your application for this change to take affect.

#### Catching Unhandled Exceptions

By default, if an exception happens in your code, Zappa will just print the stacktrace into a CloudWatch log. If you wish to use an external reporting tool to take note of those exceptions, you can use the `exception_handler` configuration option.

zappa_settings.json:
```javascript
{
    "dev": {
        ...
        "exception_handler": "your_module.unhandled_exceptions",
    },
    ...
}
```

The function has to accept three arguments: exception, event, and context:

your_module.py
```python
def unhandled_exceptions(e, event, context):
    send_to_raygun(e, event)  # gather data you need and send
```

## Hacks

Zappa goes quite far beyond what Lambda and API Gateway were ever intended to handle. As a result, there are quite a few hacks in here that allow it to work. Some of those include, but aren't limited to..

* Using VTL to map body, headers, method, params and query strings into JSON, and then turning that into valid WSGI.
* Attaching response codes to response bodies, Base64 encoding the whole thing, using that as a regex to route the response code, decoding the body in VTL, and mapping the response body to that.
* Packing and _Base58_ encoding multiple cookies into a single cookie because we can only map one kind.
* Turning cookie-setting 301/302 responses into 200 responses with HTML redirects, because we have no way to set headers on redirects.
